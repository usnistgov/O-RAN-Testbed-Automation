## User Equipment

The User Equipment (UE) is a simulated device utilizing the srsRAN_4G software provided by srsRAN [[1]][srsran-srsue], designed to connect to the gNodeB and establish a PDU session with the 5G Core Network based on the specifications outlined in 3GPP TS 36.300 [[2]][ts2430-3gpp], 3GPP TS 36.331 [[3]][ts2440-3gpp], 3GPP TS 36.401 [[4]][ts2442-3gpp], 3GPP TS 36.413 [[5]][ts2446-3gpp], and 3GPP TS 23.401 [[6]][ts849-3gpp].

## Usage

- **Compile**: Use `./full_install.sh` to build and install the UE software.
- **Generate Configurations**: Use `./generate_configurations.sh` to create configuration files.
  - Configuration files can be accessed and modified in the `configs` directory.
- **Start the UE**: Use `./run.sh` to start the UE, or `./run_background.sh` to run it as a background process where the output is redirected to `logs/ue1_stdout.txt`.
  - To operate multiple UEs, execute `./run.sh <N>` or `./run_background.sh <N>`, where `<N>` is an identifying number for the UE. If the subscriber information for `<N>` is not registered with the 5G Core, the script will automatically generate and register the subscriber information before starting the UE.
- **Stop the UE**: Terminate the UE with `./stop.sh`.
  - To stop an individual UE, use `./stop.sh <N>`.
- **Status**: Check running UEs with `./is_running.sh`. The output will display which UEs are running.
- **Logs**: Access logs by navigating to the `logs` directory.
- **Uninstall**: Use `./uninstall.sh` to remove the UE software.

## Multiple UEs

The `run.sh`, `run_background.sh` and `stop.sh` scripts can be given an optional `<N>` argument (default: 1) to specify which UE to run or stop. Each UE is assigned the following unique parameters:

- IMEI
- IMSI
- Key
- Network namespace

To customize the SIM subscriber information or to get more information about how they are generated, refer to the `ue_credentials_generator.sh` script. For UE 1, UE 2, and UE 3, the SIM subscriber information is pre-registered with the 5G Core Network. For `<N>` values greater than 3, the unique values are generated dynamically, registered with the 5G Core, and stored in the `configs` directory as their own `ue<N>.conf` file before starting the UE software.

## Interacting with the UE

- **Simulate UE traffic to Core**:
  `./additional_scripts/simulate_ue_traffic_to_core.sh <UE_NUMBER> [BANDWIDTH] [DURATION]`
  - Sends traffic from the UE to the core. Default bandwidth: 1M, duration: 60s.

- **Simulate Core traffic to UE**:
  `./additional_scripts/simulate_core_traffic_to_ue.sh <UE_NUMBER> [BANDWIDTH] [DURATION]`
  - Sends traffic from the core to the UE. Default bandwidth: 1M, duration: 60s.

- **Open UE shell**:
  `./additional_scripts/open_ue_shell.sh <UE_NUMBER>`
  - Opens a shell in the UE's network namespace.
